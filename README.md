# WIP
This is work in progress and I got stuck on having to rebuild libgusb because they dun'goof'd a while back... I have my own daily issues and this little pet project has proven more stress than I care to invest right now. I'll be back at it, some day. Maybe. Or someone else can rebuild libgusb to [fix this mishap](https://github.com/hughsie/libgusb/issues/9) (`g_usb_device_get_interfaces` needs to be `0.1.0`) Cheers.
